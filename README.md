# PhoneRecovery
Notes on my work with cell phone recovery and forensics.

(Please see the file in this repo that describes the important detailed steps required).

## LG Prepaid LML212VL Android phone
My cell phone died and fortunately I had an identical one which was previously
used by someone else until they purchased a high end phone.  I performed several
steps to transfer/mirror my phone over to the new phone including resetting the phone and installing required apps.


## Samsung Galaxy S23 forensics and virus eradication
I was given this phone to fix for a relative.  They could not use certain apps and they keep getting virus flags
in their notifications. This happened after they installed a free Security software suite (of which I was immediately
suspect).

## Here are some of the steps I took. 
(Please see the file in this repo that describes the important detailed steps required).
  1. I isolated the phone from all networks.
  2. I gained permanent access to the phone.
  3. I researched the rogue app(s) and removed them.
  4. I scanned the device with 3 different industry standard anti malware programs.
  5. I backed up the phone to the cloud and via adb to my PC so that I can restore it if there are any
     more issues or in case I lose data while working in the phone file system.
